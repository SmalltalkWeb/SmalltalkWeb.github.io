# SmalltalkWeb: United Smalltalk for the Web

The SmalltalkWeb initiative, aims to unite projects related to the Smalltalk language and web technologies. The goal is to foster collaboration, cross-dialect compatibility, and open-source innovation.

The initiative is open to all dialects of Smalltalk, encouraging cross-dialect reuse whenever possible to maximize efficiency and innovation. Emphasizing accessibility and community involvement, Smalltalk Web operates under a free, open-source license similar to the MIT license. Our goal is to ensure that the technology remains both business friendly and freely available and adaptable for all users.
