# SmalltalkWeb: United Smalltalk for the Web

The SmalltalkWeb initiative, aims to unite projects related to the Smalltalk language and web technologies. The goal is to foster collaboration, cross-dialect compatibility, and open-source innovation.

The initiative is open to all dialects of Smalltalk, encouraging cross-dialect reuse whenever possible to maximize efficiency and innovation. Emphasizing accessibility and community involvement, Smalltalk Web operates under a free, open-source license similar to the MIT license. Our goal is to ensure that the technology remains both business friendly and freely available and adaptable for all users.

## Projects Catalog

Smalltalk supports developing both web clients and servers. Servers obviously support HTTP requests. Some projects target REST API developement.
Clients can be of various levels of complexity as requested by projects. 
They of course run on the web browser and interact with third-party JavaScript and CSS libraries.
Some projects also offer a broader support, allowing code to be run in Electron or NodeGui or as a back-end solution on Node.js, deno or bun.
