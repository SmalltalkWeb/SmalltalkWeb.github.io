# Web Smalltalk

Web Smalltalk is an initiative that aims at gathering projects
related to the Smalltalk language and the World Wide Web.

With Smalltalk Web frameworks, you can develop your code in Smalltalk and run it in the browser.
Most of the frameworks also offer a broader support, allowing code to be run in Electron or NodeGui or as a back-end solution on Node.js, deno or bun.

Currently the following frameworks are included (alphabetically), but more are welcome:\
[CodeParadise](https://github.com/ErikOnBike/CodeParadise),
[PharoJS](https://pharojs.org) including [WebST](https://github.com/WebSmalltalk) and
[SmallJS](https://small-js.org).

## Use Cases

The file [UseCases.md](UseCases.md) describes typical use cases per framework.

## Features

The file [Features.md](Features.md) compares features of the frameworks.
